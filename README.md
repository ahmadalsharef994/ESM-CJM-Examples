**Last Updated:** 2 years ago

## Overview

This repository is a collection of examples demonstrating the use of IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), ESM (ECMAScript Modules), and CJM (CommonJS Modules). Additionally, it includes a Jenkins pipeline setup to facilitate continuous integration and delivery processes.

## Repository Structure

- **IIFE.js**: Example script using Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.
- **CJM.js**: Example using CommonJS module syntax.
- **ESM.js**: Script demonstrating ECMAScript Module usage.
- **Jenkinsfile**: Configuration file for Jenkins pipelines.
- **index.js**, **package.json**, **package-lock.json**: Standard Node.js project files.
- **.jenkins/**: Contains Jenkins pipeline examples and associated shell scripts.

## Jenkins Pipeline

The `Jenkinsfile` included in this repository outlines a pipeline for automated testing and delivery. The `scripts` subdirectory contains shell scripts executed during the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of the Jenkins pipeline.

## Getting Started

To run and test the examples locally:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate into the project directory.
3. For Node.js scripts, run:

node <script-name.js>

Replace `<script-name.js>` with the name of the script you want to run (e.g., `IIFE.js`, `CJM.js`, `ESM.js`).

## Contributing

Contributions to enhance or expand the example scripts and Jenkins pipeline setups are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
